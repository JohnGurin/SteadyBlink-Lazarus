# SteadyBlink-Lazarus
Periodically (every 5 seconds) shows an eye image in the middle of the screen as a reminder to blink.

OS: Windows XP - Windows 11, 32/64

## VirusTotal report
Due to the nature of the application, I expected the binary would trigger VirustTotal to give false positives. I don't have incentives to resolve this nuisance for now.

## TODO
1) User profile settings (timings, language, image / size / position)
2) Eye blink animation
3) Multiple screens support
4) Menu "Add to"/"Remove from" startup
5) Single Instance
6) Period jitter
